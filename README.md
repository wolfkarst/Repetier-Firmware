# RF1000 Firmware
Based on Repetier-Firmware - the fast and user friendly firmware.

## Installation

The firmware is compiled and downloaded with Arduino V 1.0.5 or later.

## Version 0.91.53 (2015-02-25)

* This is the development branch on base of the V 0.91.52 stable release.
* It may contain more features than the master branch but it also can be less stable.

## Printing and milling

This version of the firmware can be used as pure printer firmware or as firmware that can be switched between the operating modes "print" and "mill" (= the current default).
In order to disable the support for milling, FEATURE_CNC_MODE must be set to "0".
The default operating mode can be configured via DEFAULT_OPERATING_MODE.
The value of the MILLER_TYPE within Configuration.h must be configured to your hardware configuration:
* Set this value to MILLER_TYPE_1 in case your hardware uses 1 track in x- and y-direction.
* Set this value to MILLER_TYPE_2 in case your hardware uses 2 tracks in x- and y-direction.

## Introduction

This variant of the Repetier-firmware has been optimized for the use with the
Renkforce RF1000 3D Printer of Conrad Electronic SE.
The firmware adds functionality which is not available within the standard
Repetier-firmware and uses the settings which match the available hardware.

The main differences to the standard Repetier-firmware are:

* Support for the RF1000 motherboard.
* Support for printing and for milling.
* Support for the RF1000 feature controller (= 6 additional hardware buttons).
* Support for motor current control via the TI DRV8711.
* Support for an external watchdog via the TI TPS382x.
* Printing/milling can be paused/continued via a hardware button.
* Heat bed/work part scan and Z-compensation via the built-in strain gauge.
* Automatic emergency pause in case the strain gauge delivers too high measurements.
* Additional M-codes have been defined in order to control the RF1000-specific functionality.
* There is no support for the ArduinoDUE.
