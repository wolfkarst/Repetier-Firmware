## Introduction

This variant of the Repetier-firmware has been optimized for the use with the
Renkforce RF1000 3D Printer of Conrad Electronic SE.
The firmware adds functionality which is not available within the standard
Repetier-firmware and uses the settings which match the available hardware.

The main differences to the standard Repetier-firmware are:

* Support for the RF1000 motherboard.
* Support for the RF1000 feature controller (= 6 additional hardware buttons).
* Support for motor current control via the TI DRV8711.
* Support for an external watchdog via the TI TPS382x.
* Printing can be paused/continued via a hardware button.
* Heat bed scan and Z-compensation via the built-in strain gauge of the extruder.
* Automatic emergency pause in case the strain gauge delivers too high measurements.
* Additional M-codes have been defined in order to control the RF1000-specific functionality.
* There is no support for the ArduinoDUE.
